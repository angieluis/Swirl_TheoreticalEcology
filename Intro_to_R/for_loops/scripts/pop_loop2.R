# Now, try writing your own loop from scratch!
#
# Let's use the geometric growth model again.
# We want to project the population forward up to 15 years, assuming a
# geometric growth rate of lambda equal to 0.98
# If we having a starting population of 500, how many individuals 
# will there be every year over the next fifteen years?

# set the value for lambda
lambda <- 

# set up an empty vector called N and the starting population size

N <-              # <------------------------------- write some code (a few things) in here
  

# now the for() loop:
# set the variable name of the indexing (suggest t) and 
# what values you want it to take on, with 'in' in between.
# Then put the code for the model in the curly brackets
# the model is lambda*(the number of individuals in the previous time step)
for( ){
    
}


# Be sure to save this script and type submit() in the console after you make your changes.
